        <h1>My Dogs</h1>
        <p>I have 5 dogs at home of which are 2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd">German shepherds</a>, 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobermann">Dobermann</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Collie">border collie</a> mix, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shorthaired_Pointer">German shorthaired pointer</a>. They are all pretty big dogs, except for the Collie and one of the Shepherds. which are medium sized. My dad trains most of them for a sport called <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzhund">Shutzhund</a> which tests a dog's tracking, obedience, and protection skills.</p>
        <p>The names of the german Shepherds are Harra, who is the most well trained and my Dad's current training dog, and Elsa who is very hyper and the smaller of the two. Next is Ronin who is the dobermann, and my favorite because he's a very cuddly and affectionate dog. The border Collie mix's name is Koda and is our oldest dog, aged 8. Lastly our pointer's name is Bronco, and right now he is being trained to track and point birds for hunting purposes.</p>
